## Hi there 👋 

I'm Tanishq, a backend/full-stack developer focused on building fast, reliable systems.

## Current Focus

I'm currently focusing on fullstack/backend and infrastructure/systems programming. I work with Python, C++, Java, Go, and TypeScript (Next.js/React), and have built real-world applications where I see the direct impact of my code. 

I have past experience in Web Development, Databses, and infrastructure engineering. I've deployed countless applications, built a vehicle routing optimizer, and launched RAG AI agents.

P.S. I'm in google team matching (2026 swe intern), and looking to meet hosts! Any introductions would be greatly appreciated! :)
