## Hi there 👋 

I'm Tanishq, a senior cs major @ ubc, passionate about building fast, reliable systems.

## Current Focus

I'm currently focusing on fullstack/backend and infrastructure/systems programming. I work with Python, C++, Java, Go, and TypeScript (Next.js/React), and have built real-world applications where I see the direct impact of my code. 

I have experience in Performance Systems, Infrastructure Engineering, Web Dev, and Databases. I've deployed countless applications, built a vehicle routing optinmizer, and launched RAG AI agents.
