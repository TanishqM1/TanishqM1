## Hi there 👋 

I'm Tanishq, a backend/full-stack developer focused on building fast, reliable systems.

## Current Focus

I'm currently focusing on fullstack/backend/infrastructure programming. I work with Python, C++, Java, Go, and TypeScript (Next.js/React), and have built real-world applications where I see the direct impact of my code.
